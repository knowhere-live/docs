# Welcome

We're excited to partner with you in exploring and harnessing the power of
geospatial data querying and visualization. Your role is crucial in making the
most of our platform.

## What is Knowhere?

Knowhere is a robust platform that allows you to query, analyze, and visualize
geospatial data from OpenStreetMap. Whether you're a developer, data scientist,
or geo-enthusiast, our tools and APIs will help you unlock valuable insights
from location-based information.

## Getting Started

It is recommended starting with the following sections:

1. [Runtime API](runtime.md): Understand the core functionality and available
   methods.
2. [Query Language](query.md): Learn how to construct powerful queries to filter
   and retrieve data.
3. [Examples](runtime.md#examples): See real-world applications and use cases.
4. [Manifest UI](ui.md): Create landing pages for maps and filters without
   deploying software.

## Stay Updated

Remember to check our [Changelog](changelog.md) to stay informed about the
latest features, improvements, and updates to the Knowhere platform.

We're thrilled to have you here and can't wait to see what you'll create with
Knowhere. Happy exploring!
